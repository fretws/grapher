  This page outlines the structure of the graph generator's input fields, buttons, and designated
  rendering area. The hope is that this graph generator will be better for my uses in other CS
  classes than the graph generator that Wolfram Alpha currently employs, though I will borrow some
  general ideas from their generator, such as mouse-over behavior and simplistic look. Here is their
  generator at work: https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=random+graph+on+7+vertices+7+edges

      <!-- The linter doesn't like me defining width and height here, but it dramatically improves
      the resolution of the canvas, and then css gets the correct sizing for the page. The
      difference is dramatic enough that I'm going to ignore the linter's protests. Please have
      mercy with grading. -->
